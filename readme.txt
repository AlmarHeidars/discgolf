My Code Louisville PHP Project:

        Interacting with database of Discgolf discs. Create, Read, Update, Delete collection as
        new discs are acquired or old discs lost

NOTE:

        To run the project I am using XAMPP to run Apache and MySQL with the 'discgolf' folder placed in
        ../xampp/htdocs. Then I am able to bring up the project on a browser by going to 
        'http://localhost/discgolf/'.

        Todo
         - add disc form: will not post if integers are not filled in for certain fields.
                 DOES work if integers are put in all fields.
