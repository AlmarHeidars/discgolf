        -IN PROGESS

        Must implement CRUD functions - at minimum Read and Write to your database

        -READ: DONE
        -WRITE: DONE
        -UPDATE: NOT DONE
        -DELETE: NOT DONE

        Your code has comments. Every line doesn’t need a comment, but at the very least 
        large blocks of code you’ve written should have comments explaining what that block 
        of code does. Auto-generated comments, such as those Visual Studio can create, do not 
        count!

        -DONE IN PROGESS

It must include a README file providing the following:

        Detailed steps on how to start the application and any prerequisites needed by the 
        user/reviewer. If the reviewer only needs to download, compile, and run the solution 
        from Visual Studio, that is ok, but be sure to document that. If anything else is needed, 
        (packages, frameworks, etc), be sure to list them. 

        -NOT DONE

        Your project code is on your GitHub account in its own repository. 

        -DONE
